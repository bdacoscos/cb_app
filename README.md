## Getting Started with _CookBook_
*********

If you'd like to try out my app, check out my deployed website:
https://cookbook-app-project.herokuapp.com/


And if you're interested in gaining insight into my workflow, take a look at my Trello board for this project: [https://trello.com/b/wBdj8Z36/cookbook-app](https://trello.com/b/wBdj8Z36/cookbook-app)


## Unsolved problems
*********
- Having issues with form validation (one can create an empty recipe, with no way to access the empty file.)


## Future Features ("Ice Box")
*********

I have many features to improve my app, but my top three would be:

1. Making the app mobile-responsive. 
2. Allowing users to see other's profiles.
3. Allowing users to save other's recipes in a collection.
